1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

    2. It means when you look at code, you see how to break everything down into components and what the hierarchy they are part of is (what feeds information to what, like a family tree).

3. Describe state.

    3. It's an object that determines how a component renders and lets you create dynamic components.

4. Describe props.

    4. Parameters that allow a component to be customized based on data.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
